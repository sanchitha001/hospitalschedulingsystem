#Code to implement automatic schedule management system for doctors in a hospital
#12-hour working days, 24 timeslots of 30 minutes each
#System manages the schedule of the immediate next day

#Linked list creation. The following section of code creates the linked list class to store appointment details, as well as initialises the schedules of three doctors as linked lists with initially, all empty slots i.e. No appointments
